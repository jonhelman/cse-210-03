## Desciption
Jumper is a game that is basically "Hangman in Reverse", where instead of getting one line of drawing for every wrong answer, you lose a drawing instead. If you're trying to save some poor stick figure from hanging, then in Jumper, you're saving a stick figure from falling. It's your job to help the stick figure stay afloat by guessing a letter until it forms the word you're figuring out. One wrong guess and the stickman will lose a part of its parachute! Don't worry though, you only get short four-letter words from a very small pool, so it shouldn't be too hard. But you've only got 5 guesses so make each one of them count!

## How to start the game:
There are two ways to run the program:
- Double click the file and play from the terminal
- Use a program like Visual Studio code, selecting the folder where the file is and then clicking on the "Run" button.

## Requirements

Python 3.8.0 or any version above.
